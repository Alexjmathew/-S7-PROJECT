##AI-Powered Physiotherapy Assistance System for Rehabilitation
Introduction
The AI-Powered Physiotherapy Assistance System for Rehabilitation is an innovative application designed to assist patients in performing physiotherapy exercises correctly and effectively. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computer Vision, and Machine Learning (ML), the system provides real-time feedback, tracks progress, and personalizes rehabilitation programs. This technology ensures that patients perform exercises with proper form, reducing the risk of injury and improving recovery outcomes.
Key Features of the System
1. AI-Based Real-Time Movement Tracking
Using MediaPipe Pose Detection, the system tracks a patient’s movements through a camera. It identifies key body joints (such as knees, shoulders, and spine) and measures angles between them to assess posture and movement accuracy. This helps in detecting incorrect form and preventing harmful movements.
2. Automated Repetition Counting & Exercise Validation
Instead of manually counting repetitions, the system uses AI algorithms to track exercise sets and reps accurately. It validates whether the patient is performing movements within the correct range of motion (ROM) and alerts them if deviations occur.
3. Personalized Rehabilitation with Reinforcement Learning (RL)
The system adapts to each patient’s recovery progress using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Based on performance data, it adjusts:

Exercise difficulty (increasing or decreasing intensity)
Recommended repetitions
Rest periods between sets

This ensures a customized rehabilitation plan that evolves with the patient’s improvement.
4. Fatigue Detection & Safety Alerts
A neural network-based fatigue detection system monitors:

Movement speed degradation
Tremors in motion
Form breakdowns

If fatigue is detected, the system suggests rest or modifies exercise difficulty to prevent strain.
5. Quality Scoring for Each Repetition
Using K-Means Clustering, the system scores each repetition based on:

Range of Motion (ROM) accuracy
Movement smoothness
Form consistency

Patients receive instant feedback, helping them correct mistakes in real time.
6. Cloud-Based Progress Tracking & Reporting
All session data is stored in Firebase, allowing:

Therapists to monitor patient progress remotely
Generating automated recovery reports
Comparing historical performance for better insights

7. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
The system supports multiple user roles:

Patients (perform exercises and track progress)
Physiotherapists (monitor and adjust treatment plans)
Doctors (review long-term recovery trends)
Administrators (manage system settings)

Conclusion
The AI-Powered Physiotherapy Assistance System for Rehabilitation enhances traditional physiotherapy by integrating AI, ML, and real-time feedback. It ensures exercises are performed correctly, reduces injury risks, and personalizes rehabilitation for faster recovery. By automating progress tracking and providing data-driven insights, it bridges the gap between clinical supervision and at-home recovery, making physiotherapy more accessible and effective.
